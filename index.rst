Document version: 2023-07-22, 10:45h EST

This document is a generic primer on how to use Amazon AWS for
software development.  We assume no prior familiarity with AWS.
Please see the table of contents below for topics covered.

.. attention:: **Disclaimer:** Amazon AWS is a proprietary cloud
               service from Amazon.com, Inc., and Amazon's documents
               are the only official authority on how to use Amazon
               AWS and how to develop for FPGA execution on AWS.

	       This document is provided *as a convenience only*--- it
	       may be easier to navigate and read for some users.

	       Amazon AWS continuously update/improve their web pages,
	       documentation, and procedures, and these may be in
	       different languages in different parts of the world.
	       Thus, the details in this document, including
	       screenshots, may no longer exactly match the latest.
