You can sign up for a personal Amazon AWS account on their web site at
https://aws.amazon.com.  see "Create an AWS Account" and follow their
directions to set up an account.

Alternatively, your institution (company/university/...) may have a
more comprehensive agreement with Amazon AWS for members to obtain
accounts associated with your institution, with central billing to
your institution.  Please consult your institution's IT department for
this.
